This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Our application is meant for 1st year students to find more experienced mentors to help them get accustomed to the university lifestyle. Our application is meant for IT and Math-Statistics student, but we might expand the functionality in the future to include all other students as well. In our application new students can find mentor groups, where they can participate in group activities and even compete against other teams.
